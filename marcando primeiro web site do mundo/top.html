		<h1>General Overview</h1>
		<h2>There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information.</h2>
		<h3>by Subject</h3>
			<p>A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.</p>
		<h3>by Type</h3>
			<p>Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.</p>
		<h2>If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: About the W3 project.</h2>
